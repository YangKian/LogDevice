## append_outliers

Provides debugging information for the Sequencer Boycotting feature, which
consists in boycotting sequencer nodes that are outliers when we compare their
append success rate with the rest of the clusters. This table contains the state
of a few nodes in the cluster that are responsible for gathering stats from all
other nodes, aggregate them and decide the list of outliers.

| Column           | Type | Description                                                         |

| observed_node_id | int  | Node id for which we are measuring stats.                           |
| appends_success  | long | Number of appends that this node completed successfully.            |
| appends_failed   | long | Number of appends that this node did not complete successfully.     |
| msec_since       | long | Time in milliseconds since the node has been considered an outlier. |
| is_outlier       | bool | True if this node is considered an outlier.                         |

## append_throughput

For each sequencer node, reports the estimated per-log-group append throughput
over various time periods. Because different logs in the same log group may have
their sequencer on different nodes in the cluster, it is necessary to aggregate
these rates across all nodes in the cluster to get an estimate of the global
append throughput of a log group. If Sequencer Batching is enabled, this table
reports the rate of appends incoming, ie before batching and compression on the
sequencer.

## catchup_queues

CatchupQueue is a state machine that manages all the read streams of one client
on one socket. It contains a queue of read streams for which there are new
records to be sent to the client (we say these read streams are not caught up).
Read streams from that queue are processed (or "woken-up") in a round-robin
fashion. The state machine is implemented in logdevice/common/CatchupQueue.h.

## client_read_streams

ClientReadStream is the state machine responsible for reading records of a log
on the client side. The state machine connects to all storage nodes that may
contain data for a log and request them to send new records as they are appended
to the log. For each ClientReadStream there is one ServerReadStream per storage
node the ClientReadStream is talking to. The "readers" table lists all existing
ServerReadStreams. Because LDQuery does not fetch any debugging information from
clients connected to the cluster, the only ClientReadStreams that will be shown
in this table are for internal read streams on the server.

| connection_health      | string | Summary of authoritative status of the read session. An AUTHORITATIVE session has a least an f-majority of nodes participating. Reported dataloss indicates all copies of a record were lost, or, much less likely, the only copies of the data are on the R-1 nodes that are currently unavailable, and the cluster failed to detect or remediate the failure that caused some copies to be lost. A NON_AUTHORITATIVE session has less than an f-majority of nodes participating, but those not participating have had detected failures, are not expected to participate, and are being rebuilt. Most readers will stall in this case. Readers that proceed can see dataloss gaps for records that are merely currently unavailable, but will become readable once failed nodes are repaired. An UNHEALTHY session has too many storage nodes down but not marked as failed, to be able to read even non-authoritatively. |

## cluster_state

Fetches the state of the gossip-based failure detector from the nodes of the
cluster. When the status column is OK, the dead_nodes column contains a list of
dead nodes as seen by the node in question. When status is OK, the
unhealthy_nodes column contains a list of unhealthy nodes as seen by the node in
question. When status is OK, the overloaded_nodes column contains a list of
overloaded nodes as seen by the node in question. When the status is anything
but OK, it means the request failed for this node, and it may be dead itself.

## event_log

Dump debug information about the EventLogStateMachine objects running on nodes
in the cluster. The event log is the Replicated State Machine that coordinates
rebuilding and contains the authoritative status of all shards in the cluster.
This table can be used to debug whether all nodes in the cluster are caught up
to the same state.

## historical_metadata_legacy

Same as "historical_metadata", but retrieves the metadata less efficiently by
reading the metadata logs directly instead of contacting the sequencer. Provides
two additional "lsn" and "timestamp" columns to identify the metadata log record
that contains the metadata.

## purges

List the PurgeUncleanEpochs state machines currently active in the cluster. The
responsability of this state machine is to delete any records that were deleted
during log recovery on nodes that did not participate in that recovery. See
"logdevice/server/storage/PungeUncleanEpochs.h" for more information.

| last_record             |  lsn   | LSN of the last record the storage node delivered to the ClientReadStream. This value is not necessarily equal to "last_delivered" as the storage node does not store all records of a log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| window_high             |  lsn   | Current window used by the ClientReadStream. This instructs the storage node to not send records with LSNs higher than this value. When the read pointer reaches this value, the stream is caught up and the storage node will wake up the stream when the window is slid by ClientReadStream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| known_down              | string | List of storage nodes that the ClientReadStream is not able to receive records from. This list is used so that other storage nodes can send the records that nodes in that list were supposed to send. If this columns shows "ALL_SEND_ALL", this means that the ClientReadStream is not running in Single-Copy-Delivery mode, meaning it requires all storage nodes to send every record they have. This can be either because SCD is not enabled for the log, or because data is not correctly replicated and ClientReadStream is not able to reconstitute a contiguous sequencer of records from what storage nodes are sending, or because the ClientReadStream is going through an epoch boundary. |
| filter_version          |  long  | Each time ClientReadStream rewinds the read streams (and possibly changes the "known_down" list), this counter is updated. Rewinding a read stream means asking the storage node to rewind to a given LSN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## record

This table allows fetching information about individual record copies in the
cluster. The user must provide query constraints on the "log_id" and "lsn"
columns. This table can be useful to introspect where copies of a record are
stored and see their metadata. Do not use it to serve production use cases as
this query runs very inneficiently (it bypasses the normal read protocol and
instead performs a point query on all storage nodes in the cluster).

shard in the cluster. EpochRecordCache caches records for a log and epoch that
are not yet confirmed as fully stored by the sequencer (ie they are "unclean").

## record_csi

This table allows fetching information about individual record copies in the
cluster. The user must provide query constraints on the "log_id" and "lsn"
columns. This table can be useful to introspect where copies of a record are
stored and see their metadata. Do not use it to serve production use cases as
this query runs very inneficiently (it bypasses the normal read protocol and
instead performs a point query on all storage nodes in the cluster). This table
is different from the record table in the sense that it only queries the copyset
index and therefore can be more efficient. It can be used to check for
divergence between the data and copyset index.

| dirty_ranges                | string | Time ranges where this shard may be missing data. This happens if the LogDevice process on this storage node crashed before committing data to disk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| rebuilding_is_authoritative |  int   | Whether rebuilding is authoritative. A non authoritative rebuilding means that too many shards lost data such that all copies of some records may be unavailable. Some readers may stall when this happens and there are some shards that are still marked as recoverable.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| data_is_recoverable         |  int   | Indicates whether the shard's data has been marked as unrecoverable using `ldshell mark-unrecoverable`. If all shards in the rebuilding set are marked unrecoverable, shards for which rebuilding completed will transition to AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY status even if that rebuilding is non authoritative. Note that if logdeviced is started on a shard whose corresponding disk has been wiped by a remediation, the shard's data will automatically be considered unrecoverable. |

| rebuilding_is_authoritative     |  int   | Whether rebuilding is authoritative. A non authoritative rebuilding means that too many shards lost data such that all copies of some records may be unavailable. Some readers may stall when this happens and there are some shards that are still marked as recoverable.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| data_is_recoverable             |  int   | Indicates whether the shard's data has been marked as unrecoverable using `ldshell mark-unrecoverable`. If all shards in the rebuilding set are marked unrecoverable, shards for which rebuilding completed will transition to AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY status even if that rebuilding is non authoritative. Note that if logdeviced is started on a shard whose corresponding disk has been wiped by a remediation, the shard's data will automatically be considered unrecoverable. |

## shard_authoritative_status_verbose

Like shard_authoritative_status but has more columns and prints all the shards
contained in the RSM state, including the noisy ones, e.g. nodes that were
removed from config. Can be useful for investigating specifics of the event log
RSM behavior, but not for much else.

A non authoritative rebuilding means that too many shards lost data such that all copies of some records may be unavailable. Some readers may stall when this happens and there are some shards that are still marked as recoverable.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| data_is_recoverable         |  int   | Indicates whether the shard's data has been marked as unrecoverable using `ldshell mark-unrecoverable`. If all shards in the rebuilding set are marked unrecoverable, shards for which rebuilding completed will transition to AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY status even if that rebuilding is non authoritative. Note that if logdeviced is started on a shard whose corresponding disk has been wiped by a remediation, the shard's data will automatically be considered unrecoverable. |

are queueing on the per-worker storage task queues. Querying this table prevents
the storage tasks from being popped off the queue while it's executing, so be
careful with it.
